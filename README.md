# BasicOop
Basic oop in php which include classes, methods, inheritance and their features

I'm new to oop,git and github. So in order to learn all of these together I'm reading a book, implementing it's code by myself and
using git for version control. Since i've covered basic oop in php so i'm uploading this repo here.
